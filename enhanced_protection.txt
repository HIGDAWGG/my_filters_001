! Title: Enhanced website protection
! Homepage: https://github.com/iam-py-test/my_filters_001
! Description: This list aims to - when combined with an antimalware blocklist (like mine) - provide the highest protection I can offer by blocking commonly abused TLDs, along with a few other protections too extreme to put in my main list.
! Note: This list will have many false positives, and may be unusable for people who often visit domains using one of the blocked TLDs. I may make exclusions if I decide the site affected is not malicious.
