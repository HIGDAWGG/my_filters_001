### How to support this project
You can support this project by:
- Using these lists & reporting problems
- Submitting entries (malware, porn, cookie banners)
- Helping me extend support for diffrent browsers & adblockers
- Helping me translate things into other languages (Sadly the only language I know is EN-US) and make this project more accessible
- Helping verify entries & submit them to other lists 

If you have another way to contriute, I will gladly accept any help I can get<br><br>

### How to report bugs or ask for help
If you want to report a bug or ask for help, you can [open an issue](https://github.com/iam-py-test/my_filters_001/issues/new/choose). I also plan on creating an email address for people without GitHub accounts, but that may take a while.


#### AV False positives
As shown on https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/bbd71cc058c151595fdb5fdf05dd72eaef540cc1017c73119cb32f6bdaf1923f/detection, people using _Sangfor Engine Zero_ for an antivirus may experence problems when downloading my antimalware list due to a false positive. This also affects [older versions](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/23fd2dc0fe13b5dbe93aeb064f856d36fed0556e26c5eced9e4019b2e9d4fba1/detection), the [iam-py-test.github.io mirror](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/04b0403b8a7505bcad62faf4bc6e7f6902fc694fc4b1d74ca0ab45ca986230e0/detection), along with the [HOSTS](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/7edc2383cf8e345a7ac036d2536d6f9d891334e0500d1f1916615f1092da8d5d/detection) and [AdBlock Plus](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/7dfae5d280876f9b506691076c5ceab8e8091a3396f3ca8b5d0ce1e635c30778/detection) versions. However, the domains version is [unaffected](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/8ba3c08d8cc03fd845aec2a1d0626ae94835ac31f4a53f6c1a1cb851da0e3a4c/detection) for an unknown reason. <br>
It is likely that this is caused by Sangfor Engine Zero's AI-based scanning detecting one of the blocked domains. <br>
As long as you do not visit any of the domains listed, you are safe, as all my lists are just text files.
