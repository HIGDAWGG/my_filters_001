#### AV False positives
[According to VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/26de04186668e7590741d1fdf8ae2e1dbc7a180a5f1e3ee87cb4087c1b7f499f/detection), some security software *may* detect these files as malicious.
This is due to my list (as you would expect) containing domains, IP addresses, and URLs used by malware.
