### Welcome to the iam-py-test filterlist archive!
Feel free to browse through here anytime you wish. <br>
Here I save dead filterlists as to preserve them long after they vanished from this earth. I have no idea how licensing would work, but for the most part, these lists are unmodified.<br>
Some of them lack the latest updates from before they ceased to exist, simply because there was little/no warning, and as the data here is just based on the latest version I have access to<br>
