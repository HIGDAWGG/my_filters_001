#### Sandbox
The sandbox is a place where I test out new syntaxes with uBo, system-wide HOSTS files (Linux, Windows), and sometimes AdGuard/ABP<br>
These lists don't actually block any ads, trackers, malware, or really anything you's want to have blocked<br>
Also, these lists may cause issues with your content blocker, device, browser, ect, and will be modified/deleted/renamed/created randomly without warning
