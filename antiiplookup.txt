# Title: IP Lookup service blocklist (beta)
# Description: This list is designed to block services which allow automated-ish lookup of your IP. This is designed to be used at the system or network level, as it provides little protection at the browser level
# Expires: 10 days
# Note: There is nothing inherently bad about these services, but they are sometimes abused by malware and can present a privacy risk
