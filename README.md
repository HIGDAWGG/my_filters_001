# My filters
This is a repo where I upload my filters. <br/>
Feel free to use any and all of them (they are under no copyright) in [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) (recommended) or AdGuard. <br/>
Please report any issues you have and I will try to fix them; please note I may not reply within the day the issue is posted as I am often busy.<br>

### Filters
This repo contains the following lists (this does not include the unstable or personal lists, as those are not for use):
- Pornography Blocklist (porn.txt) ([Subscribe](https://iam-py-test.github.io/add_list.html?id=1))
- Malware domains and URLs list (antimalware.txt) ([Subscribe](https://iam-py-test.github.io/add_list.html?id=2))
- Anti-cookie-consent and paywalls list (anti-cookie+sign up.txt) ([Subscribe](https://iam-py-test.github.io/add_list.html?id=3))
- The clickbait blocklist (clickbait.txt) ([Subscribe](https://iam-py-test.github.io/add_list.html?id=4))

- Anti-typosquatting list (antitypo.txt)
- Annoyances (annoyances.txt)
- Anti-Norton tracking list (anti-norton-tracking.txt)

These lists are designed for uBlock Origin and may work in AdGuard. They are untested in AdBlock Plus.<br/>
If you need these lists in other formats, you can use the following. 
Note that the _Anti cookie-conset and paywalls list_ does not work as well in other formats, and only exists in uBlock Origin/AdGuard format.
