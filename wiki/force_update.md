### How to force-update your filterlists in uBlock Origin

If you want to make sure an issue has not been fixed in the latest version of a filterlist or have been told to "force update your filterlists", but are not sure how to do that, this guide hopefully will help.

1. Click on the uBlock Origin icon<br>

2. Click on the gears<br>

3. This will open the uBlock Origin settings. If you have never opened the settings before (at least since installing uBlock Origin in this browser), it probably will bring you to the main area. To update your filters, you need to click on the tab _on the settings page_ labeled **Filter lists**<br>

4. Click the _Purge all caches_ button<br>

5. The _Update now_ button will light up. Click it and wait for your filterlists to update<br>

6. The _Update now_ button will remain light up until your filterlists are all updated. Once it is grayed out again, you can close the tab<br>

If you see a red icon next to the triangle - or if the _Update now_ button never becomes grayed out again, check your internet connection<br>

Depending on what browser and OS (Operating System - i.e. Microsoft Windows, Apple iOS or MacOS, Google ChromeOS or Android, Linux Ubuntu, etc) this will look different. <br>
The screenshots are from a Windows 11 Virtual Machine, but hopefully they are similar on other systems. <br>
If there is something wrong with this page, open an issue here, DM me on Twitter (as iam_py_test), or email me (my email is iam-py-test@protonmail.com). <br>
If someone knows how to translate this into a language other than English, please contact me, as I would like to expand this so people who do not speak/read English can understand it. Thanks :)<br>
