## Fix browser-based malware

### Remove spam notifications
Malicious websites can send you spammy notifications, such as fake warnings about malware: <br>
<img src="spam notifiation 1.jpg" width=300 height=300>
<img src="notification spam 2.jpg" width=300 height=300>

Revoke the ability to send notifiations for all but sites which need it and which you trust:
- Chrome: https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/114662 (under Learn about permissions that can be changed, then scroll down)
- Firefox: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/push-notifications-firefox#w_how-do-i-revoke-web-push-permissions-for-a-specific-site ([Firefox for Android](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/manage-notifications-firefox-android))

If that does not work or you want to be sure, clear your browser cache and site data, which should remove the code which is causing these issues: <br>

### Change search engine and homepage/new tab
