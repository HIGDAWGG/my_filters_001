## The malicious website blocklist manifesto
The goal of the The malicious website blocklist is to protect users from threats to their online security. This includes:
- Malware
- Phishing
- Scams. Including but not limited to:
    - Fake giveaways or gifts
- Stalkerware
    - Products designed to allow someone to spy on someone else without their consent or knowledge. See https://stopstalkerware.org/ for a better definition.
    - **I am not an expert in stalkerware. This is not a decided stalkerware blocklist. Do not rely on it to block this form of malware.**
