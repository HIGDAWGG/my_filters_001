### What OS/browser do you have (optional)

### What list(s) are you using?
- [ ] Porn.txt
- [ ] Antirickroll
- [ ] Antimalware
- [ ] Other (explain)
### What other lists do you have (optional - helps me find the problem)

### What is the issue?

- [ ] Is this a feature request?
- [ ] Is this site breakage?
- [ ] Did you test in Firefox <!--a lot of issues are caused by Chromium browsers  and are irrelevent to my filters & your adblocker -->
- [ ] Does this problem still occur when the website is force reloaded? (Control-Shift-R for most browsers on Linux, Cmd-Shift-R for MacOS) <!--many filters are not applied until the page is force reloaded-->
- [ ] Did you test:
   - [ ] In another browser
   - [ ] In an modified browser profile
   - [ ] On another device
   - [ ] When disabling all other lists except the defaults
   - [ ] When disabling all other extentions
   - [ ] On the latest version for your OS, browser, and adblocker <!-- this could be an issue with one of those, or lack of support -->
   - [ ] Using an up-to-date version of uBlock Origin or AdGuard <!--some problems can be caused by using obscure adblockers, or unmaintained/scammy clones. Please do not waste my time fixing issues caused by extentions like uBlock-->
#### If it is site breakage, how is the site broken:

#### Did you try updating your lists? This could fix the problem.
