! Title: The cleaner Tor list (not maintained)
! Description: This list is not maintained and only has one entry
! Original Description: Do you want to use Tor for enhanced privacy/security, or because it is the only way to escape censorship, but want to stay clear of the darker parts of it? This list tries to do that, but I bet there are a lot of places I never have discovered
! Expires: 90 days
! Homepage: https://github.com/iam-py-test/my_filters_001
! Legal T&C:
!   This list is under CC0, so feel free to do whatever you want with it as long as you aren't using it as a directory of bad sites (which it is pretty poor at anyway)

! --- sites which are disgusting but not technically illegal (in the US/UK/EU anyway) ---
