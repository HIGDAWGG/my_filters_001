! Title: Anti-visit counters
! Homepage: https://github.com/iam-py-test/my_filters_001
! Description: You know those "number of times this page has been viewed" counter images? I personally find those annoying. This is clearly just my opinion, but for those who don't want to see those anymore, this list is for you. It is very much still a work-in-progress!

! GitHub proxies images through their servers, bypassing the above rules
! as of currently, I lack a solution - the rules below hide the counters but do not prevent your visit from being counted
